# NavCog3

## Yanda's change

- Added dependency `RBManager`, a library for communication with ROS bridge.
- Send `{x, y, z}` in `navigation/NavDataStore.m`, specifically, in `postLocationNotification`

## Example of localization
This app uses BasicLocalizer in [blelocpp](http://github.com/hulop/blelocpp) library to localize user's location by observing bluetooth LE beacons signals.

You need to provide a [model file](https://github.com/hulop/NavCogIOSv3/wiki/Prepare-data-for-localization) for localization.

## UI Mode
- **Blind User Mode**: This mode is for blind users.
- **Wheel Chair / General Pedestrian Mode**: This mode is mainly for wheel chair users and also all sighted users.

## NavCog3 Tools
The workspace also includes the following tools.

- **NavCogFingerPrint**: For fingerprinting
- **NavCogTool**: For simulate blind user navigation commands
